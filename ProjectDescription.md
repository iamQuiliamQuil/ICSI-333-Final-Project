# ICSI-333-Final-Project

Students were instructed to build the board game “Battleship” in C without the use of an IDE, 
relying instead on bash and a text editor. This project would interface through the command line; 
it would be capable of playing “solo”, with a player against a randomly generated game board, or 
with two players over an internet connection, facilitated with server and client sockets also 
written in C. It would also create a log file by storing each player’s move in a linked list and
unpacking it then writing it to a log file at the end of the game. This project was split into 
four sub-projects, where the requirements of the next project were left unknown until the previous
was finished, so as to simulate the real-world issues that can arise when one has to re-use code
for a task that they did not foresee having to re-use said code for.
